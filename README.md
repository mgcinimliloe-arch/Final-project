The Trucking Management System is a Flask web application that helps manage trucking expenses and income. It allows users to record transactions such as income, expenses, and balance adjustments, while automatically updating the account balance. All data is stored in an SQLite database using Flask-SQLAlchemy. The system includes a History page with search and filter options, making it easy to review financial activity and manage trucking operations efficiently.
